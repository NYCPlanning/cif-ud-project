            <p>The first kind of ADU type is attached. This kind of unit often takes up an existing space in a house like an attached garage, 
                but can also be a newly constructed space.
            </p>
            <p>This kind of ADU is particularly great on small lots or on lots where parking is not a need of the primary occupant.</p>
            <p>Ample walkway space is required to the back of the unit in order to build this type of ADU.</p>

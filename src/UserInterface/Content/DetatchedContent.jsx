            <p>The detached ADU is similar to the attached. The primary difference is that detached ADUs are not physically connected to their primary unit.

                Like its attached counterpart, the detached ADU is particularly great on small lots or on lots where parking is not a need of the primary occupant, 
                and ample walkway space is required to the back of the unit in order to build this type of ADU.
